#B CSS Folder 

The intent of the background CSS files is to add some random flare and changes to the home page and to individual posts. 

Usage: In the YAML front matter use the background variable like 

background: file name

However, do not include the .css at the end. If you do, the CSS style will not be applied (it messes with class names).  

Within the CSS file, name the class the same as the file name and add the styles within that class.

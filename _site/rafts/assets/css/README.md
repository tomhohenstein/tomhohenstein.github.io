#CSS

This folder is for all of my CSS files and SASS files. Also, an FYI that I have a tendency to use CSS as a catchall for both CSS and SASS files. 

Here is a quick breakdown of the CSS file structure. 

Folders:

* b - for post backgrounds
* fonts - font icons for bootstrap carousel and other font files 
* l - for CSS libraries, like bootstrap 
* p - for page-specific CSS files, like for the about page 

Files: 

* style.scss - the base style sheet for the entire site
* README.md - that is this file silly. 

Note: Additional SASS files are located in _scss. Files in _scss are SASS files that are included using @import.

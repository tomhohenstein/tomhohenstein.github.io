While it was a relatively small feat, I want to make note of sharing my first [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) on my blog. Before enrolling in [DST4L - Data Science Training for Librarians](http://altbibl.io/dst4l/) - last fall, I didn't even know what an IPython notebook was, let along how to share them. 

Sharing  notebooks is actually a very easy task. In the file menu select the "Download as" and then select HTML. IPython will will generate an HTML file with all the necessary CSS and voila. After that, simple upload the HTML file to your website and you're set. In an ideal world, I would like to simply the code by breaking out the CSS into a separate file but that task will have to wait for now. 

My [first notebook walks](/notebooks/gps-majors-2010-2013/) through taking a data set about academic course information and pulling student majors from 2010-2013 for a specific class. After gathering the data and tabulating the student counts, I then export the data into a JSON file. To make the most of my work, I actually use this data in my first to build [my first D3 bar chart](/My-First-D3-Bar-Chart/). It was a fun little project and if you're interested, [check out the demo](/projects/barchart/).

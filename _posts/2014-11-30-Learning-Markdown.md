While I enjoy marking up text with HTML, it is in my interest to learn, and master, markdown. This post is a little playpen for me to learn and document learning markdowns. 

Let's start with some basics 

# Heading 1 

## Heading 2 

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

### Text Basics

Now for a paragraph of text. I have written a few sentences of text. 
This is on a new line in my text editor, but it should be in the same paragraph. 

Text separated by an empty lines start a new paragraph. 

An unordered list:

* item 
* item 
* item 

Ordered list:
 
1. item 
2. item 
3. item 

And a nested list: 

1. item 
  * sub-item 
  * sub-item 
    1. sub-sub-item 
    2. sub-sub-item 
  * sub-item 
2. item 


*italic text*

**bold text**

~~strikethrough~~ 

'as is text s p  a   c   i  n g'

After neglecting my website for 18 months I've decided to rebuild it. If you're looking for old content, you can find in the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160806073309/http://tomhohenstein.com:80/) - the data visualizations no longer work but the gist is there.

I've decided to go with a simple Jekyll theme called [Heather](https://github.com/jxnblk/Heather) and made a few tweaks to the front page, font, and footer.

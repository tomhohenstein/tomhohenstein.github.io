<div id="chart"></div>

I am taking a [Library Juice Academy](http://libraryjuiceacademy.com/) class on using [D3](http://d3js.org/). This bar chart was my first assignment, which I handed in late :(. But, I have a much better understanding of how to create bar charts with D3 after completing the assignment.

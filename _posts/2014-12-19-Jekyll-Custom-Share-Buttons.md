As I continue building out this site, I thought it would be a good idea to write posts as I develop features and solve problems. This post is on how to build custom share buttons for posts and pages. 

## Resources
I found the following posts very useful on how to best use Jekyll to create custom share buttons for social media platforms: 

* [Wenli Zhang's](http://zhangwenli.com/) [Make Your Own Social Shareing Bar with Jekyll](http://zhangwenli.com/blog/2014/08/03/make-your-own-social-sharing-bar-with-jekyll/)
* [Scott N Decker's](http://scottndecker.com/Contact/) [How to Make Custom Share Buttons with Jekyll](http://scottndecker.com/blog/2014/06/29/How-to-Make-Custom-Share-Buttons-with-Jekyll/)
* Eric Lagergren's [Dynamic Sharing for Jekyll](http://www.ericlagergren.com/blog/dynamic-sharing-buttons/)

## Platforms 

As a relative newbee to creating social media share buttons, it is probably best to focus on only a few platforms that I use, rather than create a "social media sharing kitchen sink." I am only going to focus on: 

* [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button)
* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button)
* [LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins/share-plugin-generator)
* [Google+](https://developers.google.com/+/web/share/)
